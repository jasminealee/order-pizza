# Online Pizza Order Form

#### Week 4 Independent Project Online Pizza Order Form, February 6, 2019

#### By Jasmine Lee

## Description

  This is my fourth independent project. It demonstrates constructors and prototypes. The website allows the user to create one pizza at a time and add one topping to it. The program returns a price based on the information the user selects and gives an estimated time the pizza will be ready for pick-up. This program does not offer delivery.

## Specifications

  This webpage allows a user to input optional information about their self, such as their name, e-mail, and phone number. While inputting a name is not necessary, if the user inputs a name, it will appear at the beginning of the output results once the page is submitted. After the input section, it is critical that the user selects one topping and the size of the pizza they want to purchase. Once the mandatory section is completed, the user must click "submit". Once submitted, the price of the pizza and estimated time to pick up the pizza will be given.
